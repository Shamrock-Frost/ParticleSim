ParticleSim
===========

ParticleSim is a particle sandbox that simulates the movement of charged particles in a enclosed space.  It simulates the interactions between particles due to electrostatic attraction and gravity.


This project was written to explore the new features of java 8.  As a result it does all of the physics calculations in parallel but also requires java 8 to be installed.
